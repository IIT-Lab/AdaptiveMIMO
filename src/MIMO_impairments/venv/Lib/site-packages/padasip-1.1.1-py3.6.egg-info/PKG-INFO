Description: This library is designed to simplify adaptive signal 
        processing tasks within python
        (filtering, prediction, reconstruction, classification).
        For code optimisation, this library uses numpy for array operations.
        
        Also in this library is presented some new methods for adaptive signal processing.
        The library is designed to be used with datasets and also with 
        real-time measuring (sample-after-sample feeding).

        ********************
        Data Preprocessing
        ********************
        
        - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        
        - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
        
        ******************
        Adaptive Filters
        ******************
        
        The library features multiple adaptive filters. Input vectors for filters can be
        constructed manually or with the assistance of included functions.
        So far it is possible to use following filters:
        
        - LMS (least-mean-squares) adaptive filter
        
        - NLMS (normalized least-mean-squares) adaptive filter
        
        - LMF (least-mean-fourth) adaptive filter
        
        - NLMF (normalized least-mean-fourth) adaptive filter
        
        - SSLMS (sign-sign least-mean-squares) adaptive filter
        
        - NSSLMS (normalized sign-sign least-mean-squares) adaptive filter
        
        - RLS (recursive-least-squares) adaptive filter
        
        - GNGD (generalized normalized gradient descent) adaptive filter
        
        - AP (affine projection) adaptive filter
        
        
        ******************
        Neural Networks
        ******************
        
        So far it is implemented only MLP neural network.
        
        ******************
        Detection Tools
        ******************
        
        The library features two novelty/outlier detection tools
        
        - Error and Learning Based Novelty Detection (ELBND)
        
        - Learning Entropy (LE)
